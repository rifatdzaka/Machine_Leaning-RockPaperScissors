# Machine Learning-RockPaperScissors

## About
In this project, I explore how we can use CNN and build an image classifier. 


## Data Source
Data can download <a href="https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.">here</a>

## Requirements
<br> 1. Dataset must divide into train set and validation set
<br> 2. Validation set size = 40% from total dataset (Training Data: 1314 sample, Validation Data: 874 sample)
<br> 3. Implement image augmentation
<br> 4. Use image data generator
<br> 5. Use sequential model
<br> 6. Model training <30 minutes
<br> 7. Model Accuration >85%
<br> 8. Image prediction can be uploaded
