# Machine Learning-RockPaperScissors

## About
In this project, I explore how we can use CNN and build an image classifier. 


## Data Source
Data can download <a href="https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.">here</a>

## Requirements
Dataset must divide into train set and validation set
Validation set size = 40% from total dataset (Training Data: 1314 sample, Validation Data: 874 sample)
Implement image augmentation
Use image data generator
Use sequential model
Model training <30 minutes
Model Accuration >85%
Image prediction can be uploaded
